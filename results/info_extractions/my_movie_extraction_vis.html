A Timeless and Moving Experience: 
Thoughts on Forrest Gump 
By Lin Shiyu Updated: 2024/09/14 | Published: 2023/09/14 
Released in 1994, Forrest Gump was a title frequently mentioned throughout my 
childhood and teenage years. I may have had several opportunities to watch it back 
then, but perhaps due to my age, I couldn&#x27;t recall many details. As an adult, I 
constantly saw short commentary videos explaining the film, which suddenly sparked 
a determination to watch it properly. I wanted to cast aside second-hand 
interpretations and <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">seek the most direct, first-hand emotional experience</span>. 
To briefly touch upon my objective view of the film: as a biopic, Forrest Gump 
portrays its protagonist with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">enough detail and charm to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">make him genuinely likeable 
and relatable</span></span>. The film <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">cleverly integrates major U.S. historical events, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">adding a sense 
of time and entertainment value</span></span>. It <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">makes Gump feel like someone we might actually 
know</span></span>—someone experiencing this absurd yet authentic reality just as we do. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The 
passage of time has not dimmed the brilliance of Forrest Gump</span>; <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the care put into the 
plot and dialogue by the screenwriter and director ensures that this 20-year-old film 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">still shines brightly today</span></span>. 
Having covered the objective aspects, I want to share my most intuitive feelings. In 
the straightforward narrative, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Gump’s life seems filled with explosive events</span>. Yet, in 
Gump&#x27;s eyes, these are simply part of his consistent attitude toward life—an attitude 
he holds for decades. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">This is something we can reflect upon for ourselves</span>: choose 
with your heart and walk steadily forward, and the world will eventually open a path 
for you. 
That <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Gump possesses such a positive philosophy of life</span> is inseparable from his 
mother&#x27;s upbringing. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">This was my most profound realization upon rewatching the 
movie years later</span>. I believe that as we grow older, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">we become increasingly aware of 
how much family education influences an individual</span>. If Gump’s mother had viewed 
him as a burden, constantly belittled him, or deemed him unfit for society, his spirit 
would have gradually withered in the gloom of childhood, regardless of his natural 
aptitude. A withered soul struggles to even nurture itself, let alone achieve success. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Forrest Gump is undoubtedly a masterclass in storytelling</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It depicts a life that is 
inspirational, entertaining, and full of drama</span>—<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a high-quality film that is both popular</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
with audiences and educational. However, from my perspective, I couldn&#x27;t help but 
have some new thoughts. Jenny, as a supporting character, appears with a frequency 
that makes her impossible to ignore, even if we aren&#x27;t meant to focus too heavily on 
her movements. Based on this, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I feel the screenwriter was somewhat lazy in 
characterizing Jenny</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">She acts merely as a synchronized character in a parallel 
timeline; her growth has limited relevance to Gump, yet she always appears exactly 
when Gump &quot;needs&quot; her</span>. Although it feels like the writer tried to give Jenny multiple 
facets while keeping her gentle, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">there is an unavoidable suspicion that she was used 
merely as a &quot;plot device</span>.&quot; 
This inference stems from the scene where Jenny bears Gump’s child. I wonder if the 
screenwriter felt Gump had to have a child for the story to be complete, thus requiring 
Jenny to &quot;complete the assignment&quot; with Gump at the last moment. The intention to 
force a happy ending felt a bit excessive; <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I consider this a rather confusing storyline 
within the movie</span>. 
Another point that bothered me was the scene where Gump&#x27;s mother engages in a 
sexual transaction with the principal to get Gump into school. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I</span> pondered this for a 
long time and still don&#x27;t quite understand its significance. Aside from dark humor or 
highlighting the mother&#x27;s sacrifice (?), <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I fail to see any deeper meaning</span>. As a female 
viewer, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">watching such a depiction felt somewhat off-putting (uncomfortable</span>). 
However, the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">flaws do not obscure the jade</span>—<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I don&#x27;t feel it ruined the entire movie</span>. 
These are my thoughts on Forrest Gump. I believe this film <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">will continue to influence 
people deeply in the future</span>. It is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">well worth watching</span> when you need strength. We are 
all ordinary people; excessive &quot;chicken soup&quot; (motivational platitudes) can make us 
lose our way, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a story told gently and calmly takes root in our hearts and endures 
endlessly</span>. Forrest Gump <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">is exactly that kind of movie</span>.
