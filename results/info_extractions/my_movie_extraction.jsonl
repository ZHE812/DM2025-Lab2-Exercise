1**\n\"\"\"\nA Timeless and Moving Experience: \nThoughts on Forrest Gump \nBy Lin Shiyu Updated: 2024/09/14 | Published: 2023/09/14 \nReleased in 1994, Forrest Gump was a title frequently mentioned throughout my \nchildhood and teenage years. I may have had several opportunities to watch it back \nthen, but perhaps due to my age, I couldn't recall many details. As an adult, I \nconstantly saw short commentary videos explaining the film, which suddenly sparked \na determination to watch it properly. I wanted to cast aside second-hand \ninterpretations and seek the most direct, first-hand emotional experience. \nTo briefly touch upon my objective view of the film: as a biopic, Forrest Gump \nportrays its protagonist with enough detail and charm to make him genuinely likeable \nand relatable. The film cleverly integrates major U.S. historical events, adding a sense \nof time and entertainment value. It makes Gump feel like someone we might actually \nknow—someone experiencing this absurd yet authentic reality just as we do. The \npassage of time has not dimmed the brilliance of Forrest Gump; the care put into the \nplot and dialogue by the screenwriter and director ensures that this 20-year-old film \nstill shines brightly today. \nHaving covered the objective aspects, I want to share my most intuitive feelings. In \nthe straightforward narrative, Gump’s life seems filled with explosive events. Yet, in \nGump's eyes, these are simply part of his consistent attitude toward life—an attitude \nhe holds for decades. This is something we can reflect upon for ourselves: choose \nwith your heart and walk steadily forward, and the world will eventually open a path \nfor you. \nThat Gump possesses such a positive philosophy of life is inseparable from his \nmother's upbringing. This was my most profound realization upon rewatching the \nmovie years later. I believe that as we grow older, we become increasingly aware of \nhow much family education influences an individual. If Gump’s mother had viewed \nhim as a burden, constantly belittled him, or deemed him unfit for society, his spirit \nwould have gradually withered in the gloom of childhood, regardless of his natural \naptitude. A withered soul struggles to even nurture itself, let alone achieve success. \nForrest Gump is undoubtedly a masterclass in storytelling. It depicts a life that is \ninspirational, entertaining, and full of drama—a high-quality film that is both popular\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nwith audiences and educational. However, from my perspective, I couldn't help but \nhave some new thoughts. Jenny, as a supporting character, appears with a frequency \nthat makes her impossible to ignore, even if we aren't meant to focus too heavily on \nher movements. Based on this, I feel the screenwriter was somewhat lazy in \ncharacterizing Jenny. She acts merely as a synchronized character in a parallel \ntimeline; her growth has limited relevance to Gump, yet she always appears exactly \nwhen Gump \"needs\" her. Although it feels like the writer tried to give Jenny multiple \nfacets while keeping her gentle, there is an unavoidable suspicion that she was used \nmerely as a \"plot device.\" \nThis inference stems from the scene where Jenny bears Gump’s child. I wonder if the \nscreenwriter felt Gump had to have a child for the story to be complete, thus requiring \nJenny to \"complete the assignment\" with Gump at the last moment. The intention to \nforce a happy ending felt a bit excessive; I consider this a rather confusing storyline \nwithin the movie. \nAnother point that bothered me was the scene where Gump's mother engages in a \nsexual transaction with the principal to get Gump into school. I pondered this for a \nlong time and still don't quite understand its significance. Aside from dark humor or \nhighlighting the mother's sacrifice (?), I fail to see any deeper meaning. As a female \nviewer, watching such a depiction felt somewhat off-putting (uncomfortable). \nHowever, the flaws do not obscure the jade—I don't feel it ruined the entire movie. \nThese are my thoughts on Forrest Gump. I believe this film will continue to influence \npeople deeply in the future. It is well worth watching when you need strength. We are \nall ordinary people; excessive \"chicken soup\" (motivational platitudes) can make us \nlose our way, but a story told gently and calmly takes root in our hearts and endures \nendlessly. Forrest Gump is exactly that kind of movie. \n \nReferences \nLin, Shiyu. \"歷久彌新的感動：《阿甘正傳》觀後感\" [A Timeless and Moving \nExperience: Thoughts on Forrest Gump].
