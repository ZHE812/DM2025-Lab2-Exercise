      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "透過本次實驗，我們可以觀察到模型選擇與系統提示（System Prompt）對生成結果的顯著影響：\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **不同模型的差異 (Differences with different models):**\n",
    "    * **Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite:** 這個模型的回應速度通常最快，解釋風格傾向簡潔明瞭，非常適合處理簡單、需要快速回應的問答任務。它的回答通常比較直接，重點在於快速傳遞核心概念，例如用「超級無敵大的吸塵器」這種直觀的比喻來形容黑洞。\n",
    "    * **Gemini 2.0 Flash (或 Pro):** 相較之下，較新的或參數量較大的模型（如 2.0 Flash/Pro）通常會提供更豐富的細節，邏輯結構也可能更為嚴謹。在這個解釋「黑洞」的例子中，它可能會使用更生動、更具層次的比喻（例如「玩具山」或「深洞」），並嘗試解釋其形成的原理（如「東西擠在一起」），提供更深度的知識傳遞。\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **改變 System Prompt 的影響:**\n",
    "    * 當我們將 System Prompt 修改為「海盜船長」後，模型的輸出風格發生了劇烈且明顯的變化。\n",
    "    * 它不再使用標準、平鋪直敘的教學語氣，而是加入了大量的海盜俚語（如 \"啊哈！\"、\"小鬼頭\"、\"老子\"），語調也變得豪邁粗獷。\n",
    "    * 更進一步，它甚至會結合海盜的主題（如「大海」、「大船」、「海怪」）來重新建構對黑洞的解釋，使內容更符合角色設定。\n",
    "    * 這項實驗有力地證明了 **System Prompt** 對於設定 LLM 的 **角色 (Persona)**、**語氣 (Tone)** 和 **行為模式** 至關重要。我們可以利用這一點來打造特定領域的助手，例如「嚴肅的律師」、「溫柔的心理諮商師」或「熱情的銷售員」。"

    "By default, an LLM responds with unstructured, free-form text. For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n",

    "The key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to.

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **1. 空間分離度 (Spatial Separation) 與重疊問題**\n",
    "* **2D 圖表:**\n",
    "    * 在 2D 平面上，所有的數據點都被強制壓縮在兩個維度 (UMAP1, UMAP2) 中。\n",
    "    * 這導致了明顯的**重疊 (Overlap)** 現象。例如，**\"fear\" (紅色)** 和 **\"anger\" (藍色)** 的群聚在視覺上可能會有部分交疊，使得邊界變得模糊。\n",
    "    * 同樣地，**\"sadness\" (紫色)** 和 **\"joy\" (綠色)** 在某些區域也可能看起來靠得很近，難以區分細微的結構差異。\n",
    "\n",
    "* **3D 圖表:**\n",
    "    * 引入第三個維度 (UMAP3) 後，數據點有了更多的空間可以分佈。\n",
    "    * 這有助於**解開 (Disentangle)** 在 2D 投影中看似重疊的群聚。原本在 2D 上混在一起的點，在 3D 空間中可能位於完全不同的深度層面 (Z軸位置不同)。\n",
    "    * 例如，雖然在某個視角下群聚看起來仍然接近，但透過旋轉 3D 圖表，我們可以更清楚地看到不同情緒類別之間其實存在著更明確的**空間分離 (Separation)**。\n",
    "\n",

    "* **資訊壓縮:** 原始的 Embeddings 是高維度向量 (例如 3072 維)。將其壓縮到 2D 會損失大量的資訊與拓樸結構。\n",
    "* **失真 (Distortion):** 3D UMAP 相比於 2D，因為多了一個維度，在降維過程中對原始高維結構的**扭曲與失真較少**。這意味著 3D 圖表能更忠實地反映原始數據點之間的相對距離與關係。\n",

    "* **3D 的挑戰:** 3D 散佈圖在靜態圖片中容易產生**視覺遮蔽 (Occlusion)** 問題（前面的點擋住後面的點）。必須依賴互動式工具（如 Plotly）進行旋轉、縮放和平移，才能真正理解數據的立體結構。\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **整體趨勢 (Overall Trend)：**\n",
    "    * 從 **Zero-shot (50%)** 到 **5-shot (56.25%)**，模型的總體準確率呈現穩步提升。\n",
    "    * 這證實了 **Few-shot prompting (少樣本提示)** 的有效性：透過在提示詞中提供少量範例，能幫助模型「校準」對任務的理解，提升分類能力，而無需重新訓練模型。\n",
    "\n",
    "* **顯著改善的類別 (Significant Improvement)：**\n",
    "    * **Sadness (悲傷)：** 進步幅度最大，從 0-shot 的 8/20 提升至 5-shot 的 14/20。這顯示「悲傷」的文本特徵可能較為含糊，需要範例來界定邊界，一旦提供範例，模型就能很好地掌握。\n",
    "    * **Anger (憤怒)：** 在 5-shot 時也獲得了顯著提升 (12 -> 14)，顯示更多樣化的範例有助於捕捉不同語氣的憤怒表達。\n",
    "\n",
    "* **持續困難的類別 (Persistent Challenge)：**\n",
    "    * **Fear (恐懼)：** 在所有測試中表現始終最差 (Recall 僅 15% - 25%)。\n",
    "    * 從混淆矩陣可見，`fear` 經常被誤判為 `sadness` 或 `anger`。這可能意味著「恐懼」在社交媒體文本中的表達往往伴隨著焦慮或抱怨，與其他負面情緒高度重疊，僅靠少數範例難以完全區分。\n",
    "\n",
    "* **表現下降的異常現象 (Performance Drop)：**\n",
    "    * **Joy (喜悅)：** 這是唯一隨著範例增加而表現**下降**的類別 (85% -> 75% -> 65%)。\n",
    "    * **推測原因：** 0-shot 時模型對 `joy` 的預設理解非常廣泛且準確。然而，我們提供的 Few-shot 範例可能包含了某些特定的 `joy` 表達方式（例如特定俚語或反諷），這反而限制了模型的判斷標準，導致它對一般性的 `joy` 文本產生了「過度擬合」(Overfitting to examples) 或定義窄化的現象。\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. 結論**\n",
    "\n",
    "本次實驗展示了 In-Context Learning 的潛力與侷限性。雖然增加範例數量 (5-shot) 能有效提升對模糊情緒 (如 Sadness) 的辨識能力，但也可能對原本表現良好的類別 (如 Joy) 造成干擾。因此，在實際應用中，**挑選高品質、具代表性且多樣化的範例 (Representative Examples)** 比單純增加範例數量更為關鍵。"

    "### **案例分析討論 (Case Study Discussion)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. 改善案例 (Improved Cases: 0-shot 錯 -> 5-shot 對)**\n",
    "這些案例顯示了提供範例如何幫助模型糾正對特定語境或反諷的誤解。\n",
    "* **反諷與隱晦表達：** 例如 *\"I would always be honest but it's great to feedback opinion... don't want to offend them\"*，乍看之下有 *\"great\"* 等正面詞彙，0-shot 容易誤判為 `joy`。但透過 5-shot 範例，模型可能學會了識別這種「為了不冒犯而小心翼翼」背後隱藏的 `anger` 或不滿。\n",
    "* **特定關鍵字的情境：** 關於 *\"BLM\"* 和 *\"outrage\"* 的推文，0-shot 可能被 *\"love how\"* 這個反諷的開頭誤導而判為 `joy`。5-shot 範例幫助模型理解這是一種諷刺性的憤怒表達。\n",
    "* **生活用語的理解：** *\"nightmare\"* (惡夢) 在訂機票的情境下通常代表 `frustration` (anger) 或 `fear` (焦慮)。0-shot 判為 `anger` 其實也算合理，但 5-shot 讓模型更傾向於標註資料中的 `fear` (可能與焦慮、擔憂有關)，這顯示模型根據範例調整了對 `fear` 的定義邊界。\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. 變差案例 (Worsened Cases: 0-shot 對 -> 5-shot 錯)**\n",
    "這些案例揭示了 Few-shot prompting 可能帶來的副作用——過度擬合範例中的特徵。\n",
    "* **動作與情緒的連結：** *\"frown a bit\"* (皺眉) 通常與生氣有關，0-shot 正確判斷為 `anger`。但在 5-shot 後被誤判為 `sadness`，這可能是因為範例中包含了將皺眉、低落連結到悲傷的例子，導致模型過度推論。\n",
    "* **關鍵字誤導：** *\"forced smile\"* (強顏歡笑) 本質上是 `joy` (或至少是試圖表現 joy)，0-shot 判斷正確。但 5-shot 卻判為 `sadness`，可能是因為範例中包含了「笑中帶淚」或「苦笑」被標記為悲傷的例子，讓模型誤以為強迫的笑容就是悲傷。\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. 始終錯誤案例 (Always Wrong Cases: 0-shot & 5-shot 皆錯)**\n",
    "這些案例通常具有高度的歧義性，或者是標註資料本身可能存在爭議。\n",
    "* **混合情緒：** 部分案例包含了 *\"#sad #happy #angry\"* 等多個矛盾的標籤。這種文本本身就包含多種情緒，模型（無論是 0-shot 還是 5-shot）捕捉到 `sadness` 其實是合理的，但真實標籤卻是 `anger`，這顯示了單一標籤分類在處理混合情緒時的局限性。\n",
    "* **含糊不清：** *\"I hope my hustle don't offend nobody\"* 這句話本身更像是一種聲明或擔憂 (`fear`)，被標記為 `anger` 可能需要更多的上下文（例如說話者是在回應某人的挑釁）。模型在缺乏上下文的情況下很難做出與人工標註一致的判斷。\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **總結**\n",
    "Few-shot prompting 確實能幫助模型「校準」對特定標籤的定義（如將反諷的 love 識別為 anger），但同時也引入了新的偏見（如將皺眉一律視為悲傷）。對於包含多種情緒標籤的複雜文本，單純增加範例數量可能無法解決根本的歧義問題。"

It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
